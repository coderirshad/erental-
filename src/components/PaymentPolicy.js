        eRentals payments come into the seller bank account registered with the online portal through NEFT.<br></br>
        The details of each amount are available on the seller dashboard via prepaid and postpaid accounts. While prepaid account are payment made by <br>
        </br>buyers before delivery by debit or credit card, net banking, e wallet, etc., postpaid account are cash on delivery payments. It also has special<br>
        </br> settlements, such as seller protection fund payments, advertising services, and eRentals Fulfillment payments.
        eRentals makes payments separately from both these accounts. The payment is credited to your bank account only if there is a positive balance in these two accounts.<br>
        </br> It may not be out of place to mention that the balance may be negative as well due to returns, etc.
        The settlement amount is the Total Order Item value minus eRental’s Marketplace Fee.
        The marketplace fee includes elements such as eRental’s selling commission, collection fee, fixed fee, shipping fee, and taxes.<br></br>
        Remember, the marketplace fee varies for each product. The total selling commission can be different for different products. So do the <br></br>other elements such as shipping fees that are charged with the volume of the product. However, the collection fee, as well as the fixed fee, remains the same.
        </p>
        <p>
        Example : If a product has been sold for Rs. 1000 online and the marketplace fee is Rs. 200, the amount that will be credited into the account<br></br> of the seller will be Rs. 1000 minus Rs. 200, i.e. Rs. 800. The same would reflect on the seller dashboard, as well as the bank account registered with eRentals.
